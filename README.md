# savannah-map-project
Flood hazard mapping is an exercise to define those coastal areas which are at risk of flooding under extreme conditions (climatetechwiki.org).The goal of this project is to create a 3D map of the Savannah Historic District, improved with additional topology, relief and elevation features, which will demonstrate, through animation, those areas of the city most at risk of flooding.
